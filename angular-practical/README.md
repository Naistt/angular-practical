# AngularPractical

This project was required for a selective process I was part of. It was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 18.2.11.

## Clone and run Development server

First of all, make sure to clone this repository to a separated folder. After that, run `npm install` to install all the dependancies the project requires. Later on, run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project instead of running it. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. This way you can check for any issues before running the project.

## API Data

The project is structured to receive real API's implementations through `services` folder. It's currently built with mock API so no http(s) requests are being truly made.
